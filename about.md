title: About

I write some things occasionally.

### Current status
I graduated from the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk) in Summer 2017 with a degree in Computer Science and
Mathematics. Since then I've been working as a Software Engineer (and Systems Administrator) for
[Rapita Systems](https://www.rapitasystems.com) who do fun things with code analysis and verification for Ada and C.

Other computer time is spent on open source projects such as [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org), occasionally helping
out with [University Radio York](https://ury.org.uk) and playing games.

When I'm not sat in front of a computer, I'm generally on a bike cycling really fast. Or in the pub.
